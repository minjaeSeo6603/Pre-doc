## Description
Imagine the team is conducting a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of different Facebook ad campaigns in increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The experiment involves two distinct ad strategies appealing to reason and emotions, respectively.

Total participants: 5,000 across the US.
Random assignment: 1/3 receive the first ad (reason), 1/3 the second ad (emotions), and 1/3 none (control group).
Baseline survey completed by all participants; endline survey completed by 4,500 participants.

## Task Description:
## Data Simulation:
Write a script to simulate the raw data:

  - One dataset for the baseline survey (e.g., with a unique identifier, some basic demographic information, and related questions)
  - One dataset that contains information on the random assignment
  - One dataset for the endline survey

## Analysis and Reporting:
Merge the simulated datasets

Produce tables or figures to evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign

## Documentation:
Provide comprehensive documentation in a README file. This should include how to run the pipeline, any dependencies, and an overview of the logic and methodologies used.

## Code Quality:
The code should be well-organized, commented, and follow best coding practices.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Realism and sophistication of the data simulation.

Insightfulness and clarity of the analysis and reporting.

Adherence to coding standards and quality documentation
